        <div class="snap-section">
            <h2>The Birth of Snapchat</h2>
            <p>Snapchat was created by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown, then Stanford University students. The app was initially released in September 2011 under the name "Picaboo." It was later renamed Snapchat in 2012.</p>
            <p>The core concept of Snapchat was ephemeral messaging - photos and messages that would disappear after being viewed. This unique feature set Snapchat apart from other social media platforms and quickly gained popularity among younger users.</p>

            <h2>Growth and Evolution</h2>
            <p>Snapchat's growth was rapid, particularly among teenagers and young adults. By 2013, users were sending 350 million photos per day. The company rejected a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook in 2013, choosing to remain independent.</p>
            <p>In 2014, Snapchat introduced "Our Story," a feature for live events, and began to pivot from just a messaging app to a broader content platform. The company went public in 2017 under the name Snap Inc., valuing the company at $33 billion.</p>
