        <div class="facebook-section">
            <h2>The Birth of Facebook</h2>
            <p>Facebook, originally called "TheFacebook," was founded by Mark Zuckerberg and co-founders Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes on February 4, 2004. The platform was initially limited to Harvard students but quickly expanded to other colleges and universities.</p>
            <p>The idea for Facebook came from Harvard's student directories, known as "face books," which featured photos and basic information about students. Zuckerberg's vision was to digitize this concept and create a platform where students could connect and share information online.</p>
