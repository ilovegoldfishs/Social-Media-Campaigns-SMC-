        <div class="wha-section">
            <h2>The Birth of WhatsApp</h2>
            <p>WhatsApp was founded by Brian Acton and Jan Koum, both former employees of Yahoo!. The app was officially launched in 2009 as a simple, ad-free alternative to SMS texting. The name "WhatsApp" is a play on the phrase "What's Up?"</p>
            <p>The initial version of WhatsApp was designed to show statuses next to individual names of the people in the user's address book. The messaging function was added later, almost by accident, and quickly became the app's primary feature.</p>

            <h2>Growth and Acquisition</h2>
            <p>WhatsApp's growth was phenomenal. By 2013, it had more than 200 million active users and was handling 10 billion messages per day. This rapid growth caught the attention of tech giants, and in 2014, Facebook (now Meta) acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion, one of the largest tech acquisitions in history.</p>
            <p>Despite the acquisition, WhatsApp continued to operate as a separate entity, maintaining its focus on providing a simple, secure messaging platform.</p>
